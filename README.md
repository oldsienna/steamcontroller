Steam Controller Template for HELLDIVERS

The Steam Controller is an ideal device for automating Stratagem codes that can be assigned to a single button. Here's an example of a customisation that's come about through dozens of hours of trial and error. The following has been remapped for a frequently used load-out:

- LEFT BUMPER: Reinforce Stratagem
- RIGHT BUMPER: Reload. HOLD for map
- ESCAPE: REC-6 Demolisher Stratagem
- X BUTTON: Close Air Support Stratagem
- BACK LEFT: Dive prone / Get up / Jump. HOLD for Turbo "recover"
- BACK RIGHT: Left Bumper (hold for other Stratagems)
- MENU: Start button
  
Installation: 
1. Copy VDF file into folder: \Program Files (x86)\Steam\controller_base\templates
1. From Steam client: Right-Click HELLDIVERS > Manage > Controller Configuration
1. Browse Configs > Templates > Lazy HELLDIVER Binding

Edit the VDF file to further customise buttons for additional Stratagem automation. Make use of **HOLD** and **DOUBLE TAP** settings to assign even more.
